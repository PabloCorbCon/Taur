Taur is a Discord bot written with the discord.py library that implements a large number of commands, although it is still in the early stages of development.

Every week we add at least three new commands to Taur, which are previously tested.

All taur's commands start with the prefix `t/`

**You can use the command `t/commands` to see a list of all the commands in the bot.**

You can check Taur's **GitHub repository** here: https://github.com/PabloCorbCon/Taur

Invite Taur to your server using the command `t/invite`.

Taur has his own discord server. You can you can join using the command `t/support` or by this link: https://discord.gg/rEZYpkX
