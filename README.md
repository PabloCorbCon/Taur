---

Taur is a Discord bot written with the discord.py library that implements a **large number of commands**, although it is
still in the early stages of development. **Every week we add three new commands** to Taur, which are previously tested.

**You can invite the last version of Taur using [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=745535486784831509&scope=bot&per:)**

Taur also has his own **discord server**. You can join it today to receive support or try Taur [here](https://discord.gg/rEZYpkX)

Invite the **developer version of Taur** to your server [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=745535486784831509&scope=bot&per:)

The developer version of Taur is not active all the time, just when someone is working on Taur. It implements the most recent commands and most of them
are not tested yet.
